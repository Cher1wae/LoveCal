LoveCal is a simple and playful web app that calculates the “love percentage” between two people.

✨ Overview

LoveCal is a lighthearted browser-based app that lets users input two names and instantly get a love compatibility result. It’s built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend, just fun front-end logic and clean UI.

This project is great for anyone learning the basics of JavaScript DOM manipulation, local storage, and UI interactivity.

🧩 Features

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cher1wae/LoveCal.git

2️⃣ Navigate into the project folder
cd LoveCal

3️⃣ Open in your browser

Just double-click love.html, or drag it into any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

💡 How It Works

The user enters two names.

The script combines the names and generates a unique key (e.g. name1_name2).

If a result already exists for that key, it retrieves it from local storage.

If not, it generates a new random percentage, stores it locally, and displays it.

Optional delay or animation makes the reveal more fun and engaging.

This gives each name combination a consistent, stored “compatibility score.”

You can easily customize the style in love.css or tweak logic in love.js.
